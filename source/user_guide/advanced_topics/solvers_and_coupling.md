# ðŸ§® Non-rigid Coupling

Genesis allows you to combine multiple continuum and rigid-body solvers in the **same scene** â€“ e.g. MPM snow interacting with SPH water, deformable FEM tissue colliding with surgical tools, or rigid props splashing into a granular bed.  All cross-solver interactions are orchestrated by the `gs.engine.Coupler` class.

This page explains:

* the **architecture** of the Coupler and how it decides which solver pairs are active;
* the **impulse-based collision response** that governs momentum exchange;
* the meaning of **friction, restitution, softness** and other coupling parameters;
* a quick **reference table** of currently supported solver pairs; and
* **usage examples** showing how to enable/disable specific interactions.

## 1. Architecture overview

Internally the simulator owns **one Coupler instance** which keeps pointers to every solver.  During each sub-step the simulator executes:

1. `coupler.preprocess(f)`  &nbsp;&nbsp; â€“ e.g. surfacing operations for CPIC.
2. `solver.substep_pre_coupling(f)`       â€“ advance each individual solver.
3. `coupler.couple(f)`       â€“ exchange momentum between solvers.
4. `solver.substep_post_coupling(f)`       â€“ solver postprocessing after collision.

Because all solver fields live on Taichi data-structures the Coupler can call Taichi `@kernel`s that touch the memory of several solvers **without data copies**.

### 1.1 Activating a coupling pair

Whether a pair is active is determined **statically once** when `Coupler.build()` is called:

```python
self._rigid_mpm = rigid.is_active() and mpm.is_active() and options.rigid_mpm
```


## 2. Impulse-based collision response

### 2.1 Signed distance & influence weight

For every candidate contact the Coupler queries the signed distance function `sdf(p)` of the rigid geometry.  The *softness* parameter produces a smooth blending weight

$$
\text{influence} = \min\bigl( \exp\!\left(-\dfrac{\;d\;}{\epsilon}\right) ,\;1 \bigr)
$$

where `d` is the signed distance and `Îµ = coup_softness`.  Large softness values make the contact zone thicker and produce gentler impulses.

### 2.2 Relative velocity decomposition

For a particle/grid node with world velocity **v** and a rigid body velocity **váµ£**, the **relative velocity** is

$$ \mathbf r = \mathbf v - \mathbf v_{\text{rigid}}. $$

Split **r** into its normal and tangential components

$$
 r_n = (\mathbf r \cdot \mathbf n)\,\mathbf n, \quad
 r_t = \mathbf r - r_n
$$

with **n** the outward surface normal.

### 2.3 Normal impulse (restitution)

If the normal component is *inward* ($r_n<0$) an impulse is applied so that after the collision

$$ r_n' = -e\,r_n, \quad 0 \le e \le 1, $$

where `e = coup_restitution` is the **restitution coefficient**.  `e=0` is perfectly inelastic, `e=1` perfectly elastic.

### 2.4 Tangential impulse (Coulomb friction)

Friction is implemented by **scaling** the tangential component:

$$ r_t' = \max\!\bigl( 0,\;|r_t| + \mu \, r_n\bigr) \; \dfrac{r_t}{|r_t|}\,, $$

with `Î¼ = coup_friction`.  This is an impulse-based variant of Coulomb friction that ensures the post-collision tangential speed never exceeds the sticking limit.

### 2.5 Velocity update and momentum transfer

The new particle/node velocity is then

$$ \mathbf v' = \mathbf v_{\text{rigid}} + (r_t' + r_n') \times \text{influence} + \mathbf r\,(1-\text{influence}). $$

The *change of momentum*

$$ \Delta\mathbf p = m\,(\mathbf v' - \mathbf v) $$

is applied as an **external force** on the rigid body

$$ \mathbf F_{\text{rigid}} = -\dfrac{\Delta\mathbf p}{\Delta t}. $$

Thus Newton's third law is satisfied and the rigid body responds to fluid impacts.

## 3. Supported solver pairs

| Pair | Direction | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **MPM â†” Rigid** | impulse based on grid nodes (supports CPIC) |
| **MPM â†” SPH**   | averages SPH particle velocities within an MPM cell |
| **MPM â†” PBD**   | similar to SPH but skips pinned PBD particles |
| **FEM â†” Rigid** | collision on surface vertices only |
| **FEM â†” MPM**   | uses MPM P2G/G2P weights to exchange momentum |
| **FEM â†” SPH**   | experimental â€“ normal projection only |
| **SPH â†” Rigid** | robust side-flip handling of normals |
| **PBD â†” Rigid** | positional correction then velocity projection |
| **Tool â†” MPM**  | delegated to each Tool entity's `collide()` |

If a combination is not in the table it is currently unsupported.
