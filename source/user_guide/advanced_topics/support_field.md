# üöÄ Support Field ‚Äì Pre-computed Support Mapping

Collision detection for convex shapes in Genesis relies heavily on *support functions*.  Every iteration of the Minkowski Portal Refinement (MPR) algorithm asks questions of the form:

> _"Given a direction **d**, which vertex of the shape has the maximum dot-product **v¬∑d**?"_

A na√Øve implementation has to iterate over all vertices every time ‚Äì wasteful for models containing thousands of points.  To avoid this, Genesis pre-computes a **Support Field** for every convex geometry during scene initialisation.  The implementation lives in `genesis/engine/solvers/rigid/support_field_decomp.py`.

## How It Works

1. **Uniform Direction Grid**  ‚Äì  The sphere is discretised into `support_res √ó support_res` directions using longitude/latitude (`Œ∏`, `œï`).  By default `support_res = 180`, giving ‚âà32 k sample directions.
2. **Offline Projection**      ‚Äì  For each direction we project *all* vertices and remember the index with the largest dot-product.  The resulting arrays are:
   * `support_v   ‚àà ‚Ñù^{N_dir√ó3}` ‚Äì the actual vertex positions in *object space*.
   * `support_vid ‚àà ‚Ñï^{N_dir}`   ‚Äì original vertex indices (useful to warm-start SDF queries).
   * `support_cell_start[i_g]`   ‚Äì prefix-sum offset into the flattened arrays per geometry.
3. **Taichi Fields** ‚Äì The arrays are copied into GPU-resident Taichi fields so that kernels can access them without host round-trips.

```python
v_ws, idx = support_field._func_support_world(dir_ws, i_geom, i_batch)
```

The above gives you the extreme point in world-space for any query direction in **O(1)**.

## Data Layout

| Field | Shape | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `support_v`         | `(N_cells, 3)` | vertex positions (float32/64) |
| `support_vid`       | `(N_cells,)`   | corresponding vertex index (int32) |
| `support_cell_start`| `(n_geoms,)`   | offset into flattened arrays |

!!! info "Memory footprint"
    With the default resolution each convex shape uses ‚âà 32 k √ó (3 √ó 4 + 4) = 416 kB.  For collections of small primitives this is significantly cheaper than building a BVH per shape.

---

## Advantages

* **Constant-time look-ups** during MPR ‚áí fewer diverging branches on the GPU.
* **GPU friendly** ‚Äì the support field is a simple SOA array, no complex pointer chasing.
* **Works for *any* convex mesh** ‚Äì no need for canonical-axes or bounding boxes.

## Limitations & Future Work

* The direction grid is isotropic but not adaptive ‚Äì features smaller than the angular cell size may map to the wrong vertex.
* For extremely high-poly meshes a BVH might become more memory-efficient.
* The current implementation uses single precision on GPU even when the solver runs in double ‚Äì an option to switch would be trivial.

## API Summary

```python
from genesis.engine.solvers.rigid.rigid_solver_decomp import RigidSolver
solver   = RigidSolver(...)
s_field  = solver.collider._mpr._support  # internal handle

v_ws, idx = s_field._func_support_world(dir_ws, i_geom, i_env)
```

`v_ws` is the *world-space* support point while `idx` is the vertex ID in the original mesh (global index).

## Relation to Collision Pipeline

The Support Field is an **acceleration structure** exclusively used by the *convex‚Äìconvex* narrow phase.  Other collision paths ‚Äì SDF, terrain, plane‚Äìbox ‚Äì bypass it because they either rely on analytical support functions or distance fields.

For details on how MPR integrates this structure see {doc}`Collision, Contacts & Forces <collision_contacts_forces>`.
