<!-- From an user perspective, building an environment using Genesis is to add `Entity` in `Scene`, where `Entity` is specified by
- `Morph`: the geometry of the entity, e.g., primitive shapes or URDF.
- `Material`: the material of the entity, e.g., elastic object, liquid, sand, etc. Material is associated with the underlying solvers, e.g., there is MPM liquid and SPH liquid, those demonstrate different behaviors.
- `Surface`: the texture, rendering surface parameters etc

Under the hood, the scene consists of a simulator that encapsulates,
- `Solver`: the physics solver that handles the core physics engine with different methods like rigid, material point method (MPM), finite element method (FEM), etc.
- `Coupler`: the bridge across solvers that handle forces and any interaction in between. -->

From a userâ€™s perspective, building an environment in Genesis involves adding `Entity` objects to a `Scene`. Each `Entity` is defined by:
- `Morph`: the geometry of the entity, such as primitive shapes (e.g., cube, sphere) or articulated models (e.g., URDF, MJCF).
- `Material`: the physical properties of the entity, such as elastic solids, liquids, or granular materials. The material type determines the underlying solver usedâ€”for example, both MPM and SPH can simulate liquids, but each exhibits different behaviors.
- `Surface`: the visual and interaction-related surface properties, such as texture, roughness, or reflectivity.

Behind the scenes, the `Scene` is powered by a `Simulator`, which includes:
- `Solver`: the core physics solvers responsible for simulating different physical models, such as rigid body dynamics, Material Point Method (MPM), Finite Element Method (FEM), Position-Based Dynamics (PBD), and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).
- `Coupler`: a module that handles interactions between solvers, ensuring consistent force coupling and inter-entity dynamics.


## Data Indexing

We have been recieving a lot of questions about how to partially manipulate a rigid entity like only controling or retrieving certain attributes. Thus, we figure it would be nice to write a more in-depth explaination on index access to data.

**Structured Data Field**. For most of the case, we are using [struct Taichi field](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/type#struct-types-and-dataclass). Take MPM for an example for better illustration ([here](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/blob/53b475f49c025906a359bc8aff1270a3c8a1d4a8/genesis/engine/solvers/mpm_solver.py#L103C1-L107C10) and [here](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/blob/53b475f49c025906a359bc8aff1270a3c8a1d4a8/genesis/engine/solvers/mpm_solver.py#L123)),
```
struct_particle_state_render = ti.types.struct(
    pos=gs.ti_vec3,
    vel=gs.ti_vec3,
    active=gs.ti_int,
)
...
self.particles_render = struct_particle_state_render.field(
    shape=self._n_particles, needs_grad=False, layout=ti.Layout.SOA
)
```
This means we are create a huge "array" (called field in Taichi) with each entry being a structured data type that includes `pos`, `vel`, and `active`. Note that this data field is of length `n_particles`, which include __ALL__ particles in a scene. Then, suppose there are multiple entities in the scene, how do we differentiate across entities? A straightforward idea is to "tag" each entry of the data field with the corresponding entity ID. However, it may not be the best practice from the memory layout, computation, and I/O perspective. Alternatively, we use index offsets to distinguish entities.

**Local and Global Indexing**. The index offset provides simultaneously the simple, intuitive user interface (local indexing) and the optimized low-level implementation (global indexing). Local indexing allows interfacing __WITHIN__ an entity, e.g., the 1st joint or 30th particles of a specific entity. The global indexing is the pointer directly to the data field inside the solver which consider all entities in the scene. A visual illustration looks like this

```{figure} ../../_static/images/local_global_indexing.png
```

We provide some concrete examples in the following for better understanding,
- In MPM simulation, suppose `vel=torch.zeros((mpm_entity.n_particles, 3))` (which only considers all particles of __this__ entity), [`mpm_entity.set_velocity(vel)`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/blob/53b475f49c025906a359bc8aff1270a3c8a1d4a8/genesis/engine/entities/particle_entity.py#L296) automatically abstract out the offseting for global indexing. Under the hood, Genesis is actually doing something conceptually like `mpm_solver.particles[start:end].vel = vel`, where `start` is the offset ([`mpm_entity.particle_start`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/blob/53b475f49c025906a359bc8aff1270a3c8a1d4a8/genesis/engine/entities/particle_entity.py#L453)) and `end` is the offset plus the number of particles ([`mpm_entity.particle_end`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/blob/53b475f49c025906a359bc8aff1270a3c8a1d4a8/genesis/engine/entities/particle_entity.py#L457)).
- In rigid body simulation, all `*_idx_local` mean the local indexing, with which the users interact. They will be converted to the global indexing through `entity.*_start + *_idx_local`. Suppose we want to get the 3rd dof position by [`rigid_entity.get_dofs_position(dofs_idx_local=[2])`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/blob/53b475f49c025906a359bc8aff1270a3c8a1d4a8/genesis/engine/entities/rigid_entity/rigid_entity.py#L2201), this is actually accessing `rigid_solver.dofs_state[2+offset].pos` where `offset` is [`rigid_entity.dofs_start`](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/blob/53b475f49c025906a359bc8aff1270a3c8a1d4a8/genesis/engine/entities/rigid_entity/rigid_entity.py#L2717).

(An interesting read of a relevant design pattern called [entity component system (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system))

## Direct Access to Data Field

Normally, we do not encourage users to directly access the (Taichi) data field.
Instead, users should mostly use the APIs in each entity, such as `RigidEntity.get_dofs_position`.
However, if one would like to access to data field not supported via APIs and could not wait for the new API support, one could try a direct access of data field, which may be a quick and dirty (yet most likely inefficient) solution. Specifically, following the data indexing mechanism described in the previous section, suppose one would like to do
```
entity: RigidEntity = ...
tgt = entity.get_dofs_position(...)
```

This is equivalent to
```
all_dofs_pos = entity.solver.dofs_state.pos.to_torch()
tgt = all_dofs_pos[:, entity.dof_start:entity.dof_end]  # the first dimension is the batch dimension
```

All entities are associated with a specific solver (except for hybrid entity).
Each desired physical attribute is stored somewhere in the solver (e.g., dofs position here is stored as `dofs_state.pos` in the rigid solver).
For more details of these mapping, you could check {doc}`Naming and Variables <naming_and_variables>`. 
Also, all the data field in the solver follows a global indexing (for all entities) where you need `entity.*_start` and `entity.*_end` to only extract the data relevant with a specific entity.
